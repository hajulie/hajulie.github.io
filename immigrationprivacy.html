<h1>Immigration Advocacy Organization Privacy Study</h1>

<p>We are a group of researchers at Boston University focused on digital security and privacy.
We are conducting research on digital privacy in immigration rights organizations in order
to help organizations stay safe and defend themselves.</p>

<p><strong>We are currently recruiting study participants who work or volunteer with immigrant advocacy
organizations. We will use this information to create a workshop that offers practical privacy and
security advice to these organizations.</strong> We will also publish a research paper with
our findings.</p>

<p>Participation involves:</p>

<ul>
    <li>One-on-one interviews with up to four interested organization members lasting approximately 1 hour each</li>
    <li>Sharing your experience with using technology in your organization</li>
    <li>Participation is voluntary, and can be ended at any time</li>
    <li>Individuals may participate anonymously</li>
</ul>

<p>Benefits of participation include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Opportunity to share your experience using technology in this space</li>
    <li>Contribute to research that will help support immigrant rights organizations in staying secure online</li>
</ul>

<p>For participating, we will compensate each participant $40 in the form of a gift card.</p>

<p><strong>We are committed to keeping you and your information safe.</strong> Only the research team will have
access to the raw data. All findings will be synthesized. Individual organizations or participants
will not be named, and we will generalize any details that could reveal the organization or participants.
Any personal information such as contact information will be deleted immediately once no longer needed.</p>

<p><strong>If you or somebody you know is interested in participating in this study, please contact us by

<p>If your organization would be interested in a participating in a privacy and security workshop after
