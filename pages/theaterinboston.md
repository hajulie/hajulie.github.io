# Watching Theater in Boston as a Student 

In my free time, I like to watch live theater, mostly musicals, sometimes plays. 
It turns out a lot of the theater companies around Boston have resources for students to watch theater at a cheaper rate. 

## Emerson Colonial Theatre and Citizens Opera House 
[Emerson Colonial Theater](https://www.emersoncolonialtheatre.com/) and [Citizens Opera House](https://www.citizensoperahouse.com/) often host the ["Broadway in Boston"](https://boston.broadway.com/) productions. 
Usually these are well running shows, but Emerson Colonial Theater sometimes does pre-Broadway runs ([Moulin Rouge](https://www.emersoncolonialtheatre.com/about-us/emerson-colonial-theatre-blog/moulin-rouge/), [Queen of Versailles](https://www.emersoncolonialtheatre.com/events/the-queen-of-versailles/))
These theatres are in Downtown Boston, easily accessed via the Green Line. 
Emerson Colonial is right by the Bolyston stop, and Citizens Opera is just a short walk away. 

### Student Rush Tickets 
These shows usually have rush tickets for students that are available _2 hours before the show starts_, and you can get _2 tickets per student id_. 

These are generally advertised on their instagrams ([Emerson Colonial](https://www.instagram.com/emersoncolonial/?hl=en), [Citizens Opera](https://www.instagram.com/citizensoperahouse/?hl=en)) or [Broadway in Boston Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/broadwayboston/?hl=en) a couple days before the first day of the tour. 

## Huntington Theatre 
[Huntington Theatre](https://www.huntingtontheatre.org/) has a mix of new and existing shows. 
Huntington Theatre is off the Green Line Symphony T stop. 

### Student Rush 
Huntington Theatre has a lot of options for discounts. 
I mainly access student tickets or HYPE (Huntington Young Patron Event). 

Student tickets are $25, valid ID required. 

HYPE (Huntington Young Patron Event) are for patrons 40 years and younger, and tickets are $40. 
Valid ID required.

## American Repertory Theater 
American Repertory Theater, or A.R.T., is located at Harvard University. 
A.R.T. has really mainly has new musicals or smaller productions. 
A.R.T. is probably one of my favorite theaters to frequent, as they do a lot of pre-Broadway runs (
